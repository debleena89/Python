\section{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{sec5}
\noindent
There has been a lot of work on automata based control scheduling but we have 
used this idea to detect code replacement attack. In this paper we have demonstrated
how schedulability of control actions can be a key issue to detect code replacement attack.
A schedulable system can no longer remain schedulable if code reoplacement attack 
take place. 

Our aim is to prepare a tool in future so that it can it can be checked against many
control actions.
