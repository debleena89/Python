\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
\noindent
Soon after the Stuxnet worm affected the Iranian nuclear enrichment control 
system and was later dissected to show that a number of vulnerabilities 
ranging from the Microsoft operating system to the Siemens applications, firmware, 
and networking were exploited to slow down the control system os disable parts of 
the systems, in February 2013, U.S President Barack Obama's executive order on 
industrial control system security brought the urgency of protecting industrial
control systems from cyber-attacks to the public perception. The critical industrial
control systemss include power generation stations, control centers for utilities, 
industrial manufacturing systems, chemical processing plants, nuclear plants, and 
water and sewage control systems and so on.

\noindent
In order to protect the national safety and national economy, it is very important
to protect a country's power grid, local and state wide transportation infrastructure,
urban and ural water treatment facilities, industrial manufacturing automation systems,
nuclear power plants etc., from cyber attackers. the commonality among all these different
infrastructures are that they are all cyber physical systems(CPS). However, in the
portfolio of systems we call CPS, there are other non-infrastructural systems such as
automotive systems, flight systems etc. Research investment in cyber security of CPS is 
extremely crucial for developing novel technology for cyber attacks detection, prevention,
and countermeasures. While various individual areas of cyber security research get 
attention in academia – for example, cryptography; crypto-analysis; network
security in the form of firewall and other perimeter security techniques, and intrusion detection;
anti-virus software, and static analysis of software to detect vulnerabilities and zero-day attacks;
hardware Trojan detection etc., much of these research focus on guarding IT systems in business
and corporate information infrastructure. Stuxnet incident brought into focus the need for further
advanced research into systemic protection of CPS because the amount of damage that can be
caused by attacking a power transmission system, a nuclear power plant, or a chemical plant is
extremely high, and cause deaths, economic losses, and even long term damage to a nation’s
economic growth.

\noindent
While a lot of the news media focus on cyber security concerns compromise of privacy and
protected information such as large scale credit card information leakage, leakage of classified
information etc., here is a selected list of incidents from [38] that concerns critical infrastructure
damage due to cyber-attacks.

SCADA or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems are crucial part of most critical
infrastructure through which sensor data is collected from physical processes involved, control is
computed, and control commands are sent to actuators for affecting control on the physical
processes. In this project, we want to focus on the cyber security of safety-critical systems that
are used to monitor and control critical infrastructures such as power transmission grid, power
distribution infrastructure, substations, manufacturing systems, water and sewage treatment
plants, nuclear or other power plants, or transportation systems such as railway networks. With
the advent of smart infrastructure which combines the usage of embedded sensors, actuators,
wireless and wire line networks, computerized digital control, monitoring etc., the cyber security
of such systems are gaining prominence among researchers , industries, as well as governments.

\noindent
In general our target systems for study are called cyber-physical systems or CPS. Cyber physical
systems are at the core of most critical infrastructures. For example, a power grid has a physical
component which consists of power generators, transmission lines with transformers, FACT
devices, and other equipment, distribution system – whose dynamics is modeled using
continuous partial differential equations, and simulation of such models involve step-wise
numerical solution of such differential equations. A power grid also has digital or computerized
equipment such as digital relays (protection devices), substation IEDs, various measurement
devices including Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), as well communication network that carry
real-time measurements from the physical components to autonomous control devices, and carry
the control action instructions back to the actuators. The network also carries measurements to
the control center, where through HMI (Human Machine Interface) displays, the system
operators can observe the measurements, and make control decisions which are then carried back
over the network to the actuators. With the advent of machine learning, much of these human-in-
the-loop control are likely to be substituted with machine learning based autonomous control.

\noindent
As described before, this network is often connected to the Enterprise network for business
reasons – such as remote monitoring to business policy based control. This exposes such systems
to simple means of cyber-attacks such as Phishing attack where a business person whose desktop
is connected to the control network could open an email containing a payload, which can then
take over the control of the business network, and in turn the control network. However, since
much of the cyber threat models also assume insider knowledge or sabotage, even an isolated
control network is not devoid of cyber-attack possibilities. A person with local or remote access
to the equipment of the physical plant, or access to the various interfaces such as programmable
logic controllers (PLCs) or other Intelligent Electronic Device (IEDs) that are connected to the
physical system for measurements and control can exploit a vulnerability in these devices to
induce an attack on the system. One could also gain access to the control network, and create
various kinds of man-in-the-middle attacks by either suppressing measurements or control
actuation signals, replaying stale measurements or actuation signals, or even injecting
maliciously planned false data. These kinds of attacks would then mislead the controllers, and
wrong control actions could lead to disastrous industrial accidents. One could also, hack into the
controllers or the various other computing elements in the control center such as OPC servers by
exploiting some vulnerabilities in their design and attack the cyber physical system. In fact, in
case of Stuxnet worm, a vulnerability in the Siemens SCADA system was exploited.
