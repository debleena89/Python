\section{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{sec7}
\noindent
In this work, we present an early foundation of a framework for code replacement attack detection for cyber-physical systems. We adopt standard techniques to build an automata-based control analysis foundation. We have built an end-to-end tool that implements the proposed ideas.  We are currently examining the applications of other infinitary acceptance conditions (e.g. Rabin, Muller) in this domain, with respect to their ability to detect different attack scenarios. Additionally, we are also exploring new algorithms for intersection automaton construction that might prove helpful as the number of control loops grow. We believe that our initial results will open up more interesting avenues in this research.
