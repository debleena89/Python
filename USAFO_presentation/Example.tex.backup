\tiny {\textcolor{blue}{Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) such as a manufacturing plant, a power generator, a power transmission substation etc.
are usually controlled by a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System. Others CPS example include drive-by-wire automotive,
fly-by-wire flight control systems etc. Among the various attack surfaces recognized by the community, the possibility of
replacement of previously vetted control software, or other software components in the system by mailicious variants by insider
attackers is an acute possibility. Recent studies have shown that almost 29\% of all attacks are insider attacks.} }

\tiny {\textcolor{blue}{cyber physical systems have been a popular victim of choice for so called cyber attacks, 
the effects of which have been moderate to as ravaging as blackouts~\cite{blackout} or 
financial loss. 
This has prompted NIST~\cite{nist} to promote cyber security frameworks 
for critical infrastructure~\cite{cs-Framewrok} as one of the themes of immediate 
research attention.Examples of such at-
tacks are abundant such as attacks on Iranian nuclear enrichment plant
with Stuxnet in 2009, on German steel plant in 2014, Ukrainian power
system in 2015 and 2016.Given that no cyber security framework is full proof, significant
research thrust is being invested in recent times to develop techniques that allow us 
to continually monitor the physical dynamics of these systems and look for any anomalies
that could be indicative of cyber attack induced problems. Early detection of system 
dynamics changes would allow us to contain the damage by immediately islanding parts 
of the system which point to possible origin areas in the infrastructure. } }
