\tiny{\textcolor{blue}{Given a collection of control loops, each expressed as B\"{u}chi automatons, we describe below 
the methodology for computing their product~\cite{DBLP:books/ws/automata2012/ChevalierDMP12},
which is an important step in our work. For the sake of simplicity and ease of illustration, 
we explain the product construction in terms of two automatons. 
Let us consider the two B\"{u}chi automatons P and Q, as shown in Fig \ref{fig1} 
and defined by the conventional five tuple:}}

$P = \{(p_0,p_1),(a,b),p_0, Q \times \sum \rightarrow Q,p_1\}$

$Q = \{(q_0,q_1),(a,b),q_0, Q \times \sum \rightarrow Q,q_1\}$





\noindent
\tiny{\textcolor{blue}{We go through the 
following steps for the intersection. 
The classical product on the given input automatons is first constructed.
Consider the resulting product automata, starting from the start state. Only 
the reachable states are considered, as shown in Fig\ref{product}.}}

\tiny{\textcolor{blue}{Intersection of B\"{u}chi automatons require a special handling to model
the infinitary acceptance condition on top of the classical product construction 
of finite automatons. We can see in Fig~\ref{product} that the states do
not contain the tuple $<p_2,q_0>$, the set of final states
 from both the automata. In  the following steps, we modify the product construction to include accepting states from
 both the automata. The resulting intersection automata ensures that accepting states of
 both the automatons are visited  infinitely often. From the set of states of each
 individual automaton, where each state is reachable from the 
 start state, we make three copies of the product automata. In general, for $n$
 such automatons, $n$+$1$ copies are made.
 Each copy has a flag with the states, as shown in Fig\ref{fig:copy}. The flags 
 associated with  the states are waiting to see the acceptance of the automaton.
In Fig \ref{fig:copy}, flag $1$ is waiting to see the acceptance state of P, flag $2$ is waiting to see
the acceptance state of Q, and states with flag $3$ signify that the track has traversed all the accepting states
of both the automatons. Starting from the first copy, the transitions are made according to the product automaton.
 A transition goes to the next flag if it gets the final state of one automaton. In general, for an automaton state 
 associated with this flag in the product, if the acceptance condition of an automaton is obtained, the transition
 goes to the next copy, otherwise it remains within the transitions on its own states, as shown in  Fig\ref{transition}.
 When it reaches the last copy, it has traversed the accepting state of
 each individual automaton. The red cycle in Fig~\ref{transition} shows one such cycle. After reaching the last
 state, it goes to the first state. In the resulting automaton, a cycle is accepted, when it passes through the last copy
 of the product automaton, that signifies the run of the cycle traverses the accepting states of each automaton
 infinitely often. The remaining cycles, which do not pass through the last copy, are not accepted. We thus augment 
 the classical product construction for finite automatons to model our infinitary acceptance requirement.}}
