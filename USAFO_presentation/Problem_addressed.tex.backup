attacks can be guarded against by statically analyzing the
legitimate control programs, and constructing an omega-regular language based timing signature.}}

%communication scheduling in SCADA systems.}}

%\tiny{\textcolor{blue}{In this project, we propose an automated framework
%that addresses the effect of such replacement attacks from the perspective
%of loss of control performance. Given a set of control components,
%a control objective to be satisfied by the control ensemble, the question
%of schedulability and synthesis of a scheduler that can ensure the de-
%sired control performance has been recently studied in literature. In this
%paper, we extend this idea further to build an automata theoretic frame-
%work for assessment of replacement attacks on schedulability.}}
