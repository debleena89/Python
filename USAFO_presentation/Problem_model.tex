\begin{itemize}
\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{ A control application system consisting of
an ensemble of concurrently active control applications / loops}}

\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{ Each control
application is partitioned into a set of tasks }}

\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{ The control tasks communicate via
a shared bus}}
\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{ The messages on the shared bus are also scheduled using a given
arbitration policy}}

\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{ When a control loop executes, it carries out the set of tasks as
specified by different states in its control state machine }}

\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{ Among all these states,
some states require bus access, for which the control loop presents a request to
the bus arbiter}}

\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{ These requests are considered by the bus arbiter / scheduler
which decides on a bus scheduling strategy to grant bus access to the different
control loops over time at different time slots}}
\end{itemize}


%\tiny{\textcolor{blue}{As discussed in recent literature, we consider each participating control 
%application is modeled as a B Ìˆuchi automaton [10]. B\"{u}chi automatons have been a
%popular mechanism of choice for modeling applications that require finite au-
%tomatons over infinite strings or words. The basic structure of such automatons
%is similar to their finite counterparts, with the exception of the acceptance con-
%ditions, as described below.}}
\tiny{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{Definition: A B\"{u}chi automaton is described as a five tuple, $A = (Q, I, \delta, q_0 , F )$,
where $Q$ is a finite set of states, $I$ is the input alphabet, $\delta : Q \times I \rightarrow Q$ is the
transition function, $q_0$ is an initial state $(q_0 \epsilon Q)$ and $F$ is a set of final states
that model an infinitary acceptance condition.}}}\\



\tiny{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{Definition: An infinite word $\lambda \epsilon I^\omega$ over an input alphabet $I$ takes a B\"{u}chi
automaton $A = (Q, I, \delta, q_0 , F )$ through an infinite sequence of states $q_0, q_1, q_2, \dots,$
which describes a run of the automaton such that $q_{k+1} \epsilon \delta(q_k , \delta_k )$ where $k \epsilon N$
and $\delta_k$ refers to the $k$ the symbol on the input word $\delta$. An infinite word is accepted
by $A$ if some accepting state $q_f \epsilon F$ appears in the run $q_0, q_1, q_2,\dots$  infinitely
often.}}}\\




\tiny{\textcolor{blue}{We consider one such control system functioning correctly if both the above
conditions are met\footnote{ \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{Each control loop is designed with a control objective in view, and the overall
 functioning of the system is dependent on the individual control loops meeting
 control objectives, along with a strategy for co-operative control of the shared
message bus through which the control loops communicate with each other.
