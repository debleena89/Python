\tiny{\textcolor{blue}{ we are given a set of n control loops, with
their bus access states marked as the accepting ones. Our scheduling
objective is to be able to grant bus access infinitely often to each control loop.
To check if the system is safe and schedulable, we carry out the following steps:}}
\begin{itemize}
 \item â€“ \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{We compute the product of the individual control loops using B\"{u}chi automata
 Intersection construction.}}
 \item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{Once the product is computed, we look for the presence of a cycle that
contains at least one state from each control loop. In other words, on any
infinite run of the product automaton, each control loop repeats infinitely
often and is therefore, granted bus access infinitely often as well.}}
