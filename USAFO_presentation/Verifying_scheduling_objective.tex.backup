\tiny{\textcolor{blue}{Once the intersection automaton is constructed, the task of looking for cycles
starting from the initial states is carried out. Cycle detection algorithms are
standard in literature\footnote{\tiny{\textcolor{blue}{Clarke,Jr., Edmund M. and Grumberg, Orna and Peled, Doron A.,Model Checking}}}}}.

\begin{itemize}
 \item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{Starting from the initiaql state, any strongly connected component that 
 contains a cycle over an acceptaing state is considered as accepting run}}
 \item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{If no connected component has a cycle over accepting run then it is 
       empty.}}
       
\end{itemize}



\tiny{\textcolor{blue}{We implement the same for this work as well.}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{ Once a cycle is found, we traverse one cycle (every cycle is bound to contain a
finite number of states)}}
\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{check if each control loop is represented inside it.}}
\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{If not, we proceed to the next cycle.}}
\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{If all cycles are exhausted and we do not encounter any one which meets our scheduling
objective, we conclude that the schedulability requirement is not met.}}

\tiny{\textcolor{blue}{Consider the example given in Figure 4. It can be
seen that there are multiple cycles in the intersection automata, some of which
do not contain one representative accepting state from each control loop (e.g.
$\langle p_0, q_0, 1 \rangle \rightarrow \langle p_1, q_0, 1 \rangle \rightarrow \langle p_0, q_1, 1\rangle \dots)$. Thus it is necessary to examine
each cycle to check for existence of at least one accepting state from each control
loop, which is the main idea behind the notion of schedulability we adopt here.}}
