\begin{itemize}
\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{ As the system is monitored over time, newer structures of the control loops
emerge and we perform the same computation steps outlined above on the
modified structures to check if it remains schedulable even in the presence of the
modifications.}}

\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{Our mechanism can thus be used as a continuous monitor to
safe-guard against intermittent control attacks.}}

\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{Our framework can point out replacement
attacks only if schedulability is lost.}}

\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{Once the intersection is computed,we may have 3 different possibilities if
schedulability is lost.Assuming that the system was schedulable earlier, we may conclude the system has 
been attacked if any of the following possibilities are detected.}}

  \begin{itemize}
   \item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{We may have an empty intersection automaton now}}
   \item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{The product may still be non-empty but a cycle may not be reachable}}
   \item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{A cycle may be found but it may not contain representative tasks from each control loop}}

  \end{itemize}

\item \tiny{\textcolor{blue}{If the system still remains schedulable according to our scheduling objective, our framework is unable to
                            flag the attack, even if a replacement has been carried out.}}
