\textbf{B\"{u}chi Automata:}
A B\"{u}chi automaton is nothing but a Finite State Machine having at least one cycle 
containing at least one accepting state. It has the ability of accepting infinite 
words over finite \textcolor{red}{alphabet}. B\"{u}chi automaton can be described as a five tuple, 
$A = (Q,I,\delta,q_0,F)$ \cite{WeissA07} where $Q$ is a finite set of states, $I$ is a set
of alphabet, $\delta$ is the transition function, $\delta : Q$ x $I \rightarrow Q $, $q_0$ 
is an initial state and $q_0 \in Q $ and $F$ is a set of final states. An infinite words
$\delta \in I ^ \omega$ over the input states $ q_0, q_1, q_2, ....$ describes a run of
the automaton such that $ q_k+1 \in \delta(q_k, \delta_k)$ where $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and some 
accepting states $q_f \in F $ will be appearing in the run repeatedly. If 
$|\delta(q,i)| = 1$ where $ q \in Q $ and $i \in I$, then it is a deterministic 
B\"{u}chi automaton otherwise it is non-deterministic.


\textbf{Exponential stability:}
The parameter that select the final state of the automaton is defined by exponential
stability. Here we are trying to construct such an automaton where each state will be
represented by $L,$ where $L \in \mathbb{N} $ length sequences. A system which comprises a set 
of states(each state represents a set of sequences) is said to be $(L,\rho)$-exponentially 
stable if $ x(t + L) / x(t) < \rho $ for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$ and $x(t) \in R^n $ \cite{AlurW08}. 
For $n$ number of control actions with $L$ length sequences we have $n^L$ number of states, for 
each state to be exponentially stable have to satisfy $ \parallel A_{\delta_t+L}\dots 
A_{\delta_t+1} \parallel  < \rho$ where $0<\rho<1$ \cite{WeissA07} and each state have the sub-sequence
$A_{\delta_t+L}\dots A_{\delta_t+1}$ . \textcolor{red}{what is $x(t)$ here: it comes from the equation of the system
which is given in problem statement}

$ExpStab(L,\rho) = \{\delta \in I^\omega : \forall t \in \mathbb{N} \parallel A_{\delta_t+L}\dots A_{\delta_t+1} \parallel  < \rho \}$
