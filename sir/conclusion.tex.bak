\section{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{sec5}
\noindent
There has been a lot of work on automata based control scheduling but we have 
used this idea to detect code replacement attack. In this paper we have demonstrated
how schedulability of control actions can be a key issue to detect code replacement attack.
We have proposed that  schedulable system can no longer remain schedulable if code 
reoplacement attack take place. To detect code replacement attack, the schedulability of 
the system will be checked repeatedly to check if any control actions has been hijacked or not.

Our aim is to prepare a tool in future so that it can be scalable and  be checked against many
control actions.
